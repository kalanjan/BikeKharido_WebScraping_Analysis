## 🏍️ BikeKharido — Web Scraping and Data Visualization
**Author:** *Yamsani Kalanjan*  
**Guided by:** *Innomatics Research Labs*  

---

### 🎯 Objective
To scrape real-world bike data from an online source, clean and process it, and visualize insights such as:
- Brand-wise pricing  
- Mileage patterns  
- Market segmentation between economy and premium bikes  

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools
| Category | Tools |
|-----------|-------|
| **Programming Language** | Python |
| **Libraries Used** | BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| **IDE** | Jupyter Notebook |
| **Visualization Type** | Price distribution, Mileage comparison, Top brand chart |

---

### 📘 Project Workflow
1. **Web Scraping:**  
   Extracted real-time data (brand, model, price, mileage) using BeautifulSoup and Requests.  
2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   Removed missing and inconsistent records; standardized formats for analysis.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Found average prices per brand  
   - Compared mileage ranges  
   - Visualized brand performance  
4. **Visualization:**  
   Created charts showing price distributions and top-performing brands.

---

### 📊 Key Insights
- Certain brands balance **mileage and affordability** well.  
- **Premium bikes** dominate high price ranges but offer lower mileage.  
- Clear market segmentation between **performance-oriented** and **budget-friendly** bikes.  

---

### 🧠 Learnings
- Built an automated scraping and cleaning pipeline  
- Enhanced Python and data visualization skills  
- Learned how to analyze real-world data using EDA principles

### ⚙️ How to Run the Project

#### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BikeKharido_WebScraping_Analysis.git
cd BikeKharido_WebScraping_Analysis
```

#### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.8+).  
Then install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

#### Step 3: Open the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the files:
- `BikeKharido Web Scrapping.ipynb` → for web scraping  
- `Bikes Visualization.ipynb` → for data analysis and visualization  

#### Step 4: Run All Cells
Run each cell in order to:
- Scrape and save data into `data/raw_bikes_data.csv`
- Clean and analyze the data
- Generate and display charts (saved in `images/` folder)
